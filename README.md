### Intro. Test frameworks
* The Big Three: [MSTest](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx), [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit), [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit).

### Assertions
* [ExpressionToCode](https://github.com/EamonNerbonne/ExpressionToCode) – A library that generates valid, readable C# from an expression tree, inspired by PowerAssert.NET. 
* [Fluent Assertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) – A set of extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style unit tests.

### Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
* [BDTest](https://github.com/thomhurst/BDTest) – A testing and reporting framework focusing on BDD ideology. It can be used with other frameworks (such as MSTest, xUnit or NUnit) or standalone. Think of BDTest as a pure code-based alternative to SpecFlow.
